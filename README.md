## Introduction 

Redux pender is a middleware that helps you to manage asynchronous actions based on promise. It comes with useful tools that help you to handle this even more easier.

This library is inspired from [redux-promise-middleware](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware), and this library pretty much works the similar as it. The difference between redux-promise-middleware and this library is that this comes with some handy utils.
